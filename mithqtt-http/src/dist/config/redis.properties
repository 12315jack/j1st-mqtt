# Options are:
# master            -   Default mode. Read from the current master node.
# masterPreferred   -   Read from the master, but if it is unavailable, read from slave nodes.
# slave             -   Read from slave nodes.
# nearest           -   Read from any node of the cluster with the lowest latency.
# Note, All settings except 'master' may return stale data because slaves replication is asynchronous and requires some delay.
# You need to ensure that your application can tolerate stale data.
