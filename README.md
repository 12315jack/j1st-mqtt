### What is MQTT
[MQTT](http://mqtt.org) is an open industry standard, specifying a light weight publish-subscribe messaging protocol. It is well suited for constrained devices on unreliable networks.

### What is J1st-mqtt
J1st-mqtt is an open source, distributed MQTT message broker for real world. It embraces the [Microservices Architecture](http://microservices.io), and designed to fit into complex server-side application.

As a MQTT message broker, J1st-mqtt scales both horizontally and vertically on commodity hardware to support a large number of concurrent MQTT clients while maintaing low latency and fault tolerence.

As a Microservice, J1st-mqtt is small self contained with little external dependencies, using pluggable Communicator to coexist with other microservices.

### Features
- Fully compatible with MQTT v3.1.1 specification.
  - Support QoS 0, QoS 1, QoS 2.
  - Support session state and clean session.
  - Support session keepalive.
  - Support message delivery retry (when connect).
  - Support retain message.
  - Support topic name and topic filter (with wildcards).
  - Strong message ordering for each session.
- Extensible authorization structure. J1st-mqtt can control operations like Connect Publish Subscribe Unsubscribe by providing authorization plugin.
- Distributed by design. J1st-mqtt is decentralized, can easily scale up and out. Nodes talking to each other via communicator.
- Fault tolerance. When used with load balancer, there will be no single point of failure.
- Redis storage. The only required external dependency is the Redis database, which J1st-mqtt used to store session state. Redis 2.8 and above is supported (include 3.x cluster).
- Communicator and $SYS topic. Communicator is a switchable internal implementation based on message queue or rpc. Normally MQTT brokers provide the $SYS topic for server side integration, J1st-mqtt uses communicator to pass messages to other microservices, which is more flexible and tied into your exist application. Communicator support [Hazelcast](http://hazelcast.org), [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org) based implementation at the moment.
- RESTful HTTP interface. Although MQTT is a stateful protocol, J1st-mqtt provided a HTTP wrapper to MQTT operations. The HTTP server is also scalabe, and can be used both internally and publicly.
- Optinal [InfluxDB](http://influxdb.com) based metrics. J1st-mqtt broker can gather MQTT related metrics and push into influxDB.

### Architecture
This is the high level architecture design for a typical application service using J1st-mqtt.
- User: Maybe a device or an app speaks MQTT.
- Load Balancer: TCP (HTTP) load balancer like Pound LVS HAproxy or the service provided by cloud.
- Communicator: J1st-mqtt internal commuication implmentation based on Hazelcast or Kafka.
- MQTT Broker: J1st-mqtt MQTT broker handle messages from User (through Load Balancer), redirect internal messages to Communicator.
- MQTT HTTP Interface: J1st-mqtt MQTT HTTP interface handle requests and transfer to internal messages, send to corresponding MQTT Broker via Communicator.
- Redis: The main storage for J1st-mqtt.
- InfluxDB: Optional storage for MQTT Broker and MQTT HTTP Interface metrics.
- Cloud Service: Application service which can receive inbound MQTT (Internal Format) messages from Communicator, and send outbound MQTT (Internal Format) messages from MQTT HTTP Interface.

### Interoperability Test
J1st-mqtt broker is tested against Eclipse Paho's [MQTT Conformance/Interoperability Testing](http://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/testing/).
